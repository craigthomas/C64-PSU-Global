For using this PSU, a suitable enclosure is required. It must not be connected to 230V while 115V mains is selected.

This PSU is designed for a low price at a decent comfort and for providing a PSU that can be switched between 230V and 115V mains.

The testing is still prliminary and a 3D printed case is not yet designed.
